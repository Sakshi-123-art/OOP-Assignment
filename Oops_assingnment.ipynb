        "## inheritance in OOP :\n",
        "Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that allows a new class to be based on an existing class. The new class, known as the derived class or subclass, inherits properties and methods from the existing class, called the base class or superclass. This mechanism enables code reuse and establishes a relationship between classes that mirrors real-world hierarchies.\n",

        "To understand inheritance better, let’s break it down with an analogy:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Example :  Imagine a family tree. Just as children inherit traits from their parents, in OOP, a subclass inherits characteristics (properties and methods) from its parent class. This inheritance can span multiple generations, creating a hierarchy of classes.\n",

        "* Hierarchical Classification: It helps in organizing classes into a hierarchical structure, reflecting real-world relationships between objects.\n",
        "* Extensibility: New functionality can be added to existing code without modifying it, adhering to the open-closed principle of SOLID.\n",

        "In single inheritance, a subclass inherits from only one superclass. This is the simplest and most common form of inheritance.\n",
        "\n",
        "###2. Multiple Inheritance\n",

        "\n",
        "###3. Multilevel Inheritance\n",
        "This type involves a chain of inheritance where a subclass becomes the superclass for another class, creating a hierarchy of classes.\n",

It is used to encapsulate instance variables, providing a way to add logic when getting, setting, or deleting an attribute, while maintaining a clean and intuitive interface.\n",
        "* The @property decorator is used to define a getter method, and additional decorators like @<property_name>.setter and @<property_name>.deleter can be used to define corresponding setter and deleter methods.\n",

        "1.**Encapsulation**: It allows you to control access to private attributes.\n",

        "Polymorphism is a cornerstone of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python, and its importance lies in its ability to enhance flexibility, maintainability, and scalability of code. Here's why it matters:\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. Code Reusability\n",
        "Polymorphism allows you to write generic code that works with objects of different classes. This reduces redundancy and promotes reusability.\n",
        "For example, a single function can operate on objects of different types as long as they share a common interface or behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "class Dog:\n",
        "    def speak(self):\n",
        "        return \"Woof!\"\n",

        "animal_sound(Dog())  # Output: Woof!\n",
        "animal_sound(Cat())  # Output: Meow!\n",
        "```\n",
        "###2. Flexibility and Extensibility\n",
        "Polymorphism makes it easier to extend functionality without modifying existing code. You can add new classes that conform to the same interface without altering the code that uses them.\n",
        "This is particularly useful in large-scale applications where new features or types are frequently added.\n",
        "###3. Simplifies Code Maintenance\n",
        "By allowing objects to be treated uniformly, polymorphism reduces the complexity of the code. This makes it easier to debug, test, and maintain.\n",
        "For instance, you can iterate over a collection of objects and call the same method on each, regardless of their specific class.\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "animals = [Dog(), Cat()]\n",
        "for animal in animals:\n",
        "    print(animal.speak())\n",
        "# Output:\n",
        "# Woof!\n",
        "# Meow!\n",
        "```\n",
        "###4. Supports Design Principles\n",
        "Polymorphism aligns with key design principles like Open/Closed Principle (open for extension, closed for modification) and Dependency Inversion Principle (depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations).\n",
        "This leads to cleaner, modular, and more robust code.\n",
        "\n",
        "* In summary, polymorphism in Python empowers developers to write adaptable and efficient code by enabling objects of different types to be used interchangeably, as long as they share common behavior. This is a hallmark of good OOP design!"

        "\n",
        "##1. Access Parent Class Methods\n",
        "The super() function allows you to call methods from a parent (or superclass) in a child (or subclass) without explicitly naming the parent class. This is particularly useful when working with inheritance, as it ensures that the parent class's methods are properly invoked.\n",
